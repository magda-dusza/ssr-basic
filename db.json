Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary.[3] Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother.[6] At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can inhabit the wolf and share its experiences"},
